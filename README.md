*Core Features*
User Management & Authentication

User Registration & Email Verification:
Allow users to register with email confirmation to verify their account.

Login & JWT Authentication:
Secure endpoints using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and manage token refresh.

Password Recovery:
Implement “forgot password” flows with time-limited reset tokens.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Define user roles (e.g., admin, editor, viewer) to restrict or allow specific actions.

*Task CRUD Operations*

Basic CRUD:
Create, read, update, and delete tasks. Each task is linked to a user.

Advanced Task Attributes:
Include fields like title, description, due date, priority, status, and attachments.

Subtasks & Nested Tasks:
Allow tasks to have subtasks for more granular tracking.

Recurring Tasks:
Provide options for tasks that repeat on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

*Task Organization & Search*

Categories & Tags:
Enable users to tag or group tasks (e.g., Work, Personal).

Sorting, Filtering & Pagination:
Let users filter tasks by due date, status, priority, etc., with efficient pagination.

Search Functionality:
Full-text search across task titles and descriptions.

Collaboration & Real-Time Features
Shared Tasks & Projects

Collaborative Projects:
Group tasks into projects that can be shared among multiple users.

Invitation & Access Management:
Allow task owners to invite collaborators via email and manage permissions.

*Comments & Activity Feed*

Task Comments:
Enable users to comment on tasks to discuss details or progress.

Activity Logging:
Record and display a timeline of actions (task updates, status changes, comments, collaborator invites).

Real-Time Updates & Notifications

Real-Time Data Sync (Socket.io):
Use Socket.io or similar libraries to broadcast updates such as:

New comments on tasks.

Status or detail changes on tasks.

Collaborator additions or removals.

In-App Notifications:
Display notifications in the user interface when key events occur.

Email & Push Notifications:
Optionally integrate email (using services like Nodemailer) or push notifications to alert users even when they’re offline.

Notification Center:
A dedicated section where users can review all their notifications, mark them as read, or filter by type.

Advanced Integrations & DevOps Considerations
API Documentation & Testing

Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation:
Provide clear documentation of your API endpoints.

Automated Testing:
Write unit and integration tests using Jest/Mocha for robust code quality.

*Containerization & Deployment*

Docker & Docker Compose:
Containerize your backend and frontend apps for consistent environments.

CI/CD Pipelines:
Automate testing and deployment using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Travis CI.

Kubernetes (Optional):
For advanced scalability, consider orchestrating containers using Kubernetes.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Terraform or CloudFormation:
Automate your infrastructure setup and ensure consistency across deployments.

*Monitoring & Logging*

Centralized Logging:
Use tools like Winston/Morgan for logging, potentially integrating with ELK stacks.

Performance Monitoring:
Set up Prometheus and Grafana, or use APM tools like New Relic, to track system performance.

Frontend Integration with Next.js
Server-Side Rendering & Routing

Next.js Pages & API Routes:
Leverage Next.js for SSR (improving performance and SEO) and create API routes to proxy requests to your backend if needed.

Dynamic Routing:
Create dynamic task/project pages that load data on the server.

*State Management & Real-Time Integration*

React Context/Redux:
Manage application state effectively, especially for real-time notifications and collaborative updates.

WebSocket Integration:
Connect with your backend’s Socket.io setup to listen for live updates and display notifications instantly.
  
*UI & UX Enhancements*

Responsive Design:
Ensure the UI works well on mobile and desktop.

Interactive Components:
Build components for task lists, calendars, notification panels, and user dashboards.

Integration with Third-Party APIs:
For instance, calendar integrations (Google Calendar) or additional authentication options (OAuth providers).

Workflow Scenario Example
User A creates a task and assigns subtasks.

They invite User B to collaborate on the project.

User B receives an email invite and a real-time in-app notification.

Both users can comment on the task, with each comment instantly appearing in the activity feed via WebSocket updates.

As tasks are updated or completed, notifications keep all collaborators informed.

The Next.js frontend displays these real-time updates seamlessly, while the backend manages data integrity and security.

This full-featured system not only covers the core functionalities of a task management tool but also introduces modern collaboration features, real-time notifications, and a smooth integration between a Node.js backend and a Next.js frontend. It’s a solid blueprint for a production-level project that can grow as you expand your skills.
